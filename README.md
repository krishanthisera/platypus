# Platypus Pizza and Pasta

Welcome to the Platypus Pizza and Pasta Takeaway Service repository! This project presents a unique implementation of a console program using four different programming languages: __C, Java, Lisp, and Python__. The purpose of this is to provide an interactive solution for our hypothetical client, who is the owner of a new Pizza and Pasta shop, to manage her takeaway service, offer promotional packages, and calculate costs.

## Scenario

Sab is excited to launch her new Pizza and Pasta takeaway service and wishes to attract customers by offering enticing packages. The following packages are available for customers:

1. **Large Pizza**
   - 1 large Pizza = 12 AUD
   - 2 large Pizzas = 22 AUD
   - N large pizzas = N*10 AUD, where N>=3
   - For every three pizzas, the customer will receive 1 complimentary garlic bread.

2. **Large Pasta**
   - 1 large pasta = 8 AUD
   - 2 large pastas = 15 AUD
   - M large pastas = M*7 AUD, where M>=3
   - For every three pastas, the customer will receive 1.25 Liter soft drinks.

3. **Combo Deal**
   - For every 3 pizzas AND 3 pasta, the customer will receive a small box of Baklava (a famous dessert item), in addition to garlic bread and 1.5-liter soft drinks.

## Implementation Details

This repository contains implementations of the Platypus Pizza and Pasta Takeaway Service in four different programming languages:

1. **C**: The C implementation provides a console-based program that allows Sab to select items and packages, calculate costs, and track orders. It presents a simple and efficient solution.

2. **Java**: The Java implementation offers an interactive console application with object-oriented design. Sab can easily navigate through the menu, choose items, and manage orders.

3. **Lisp**: The Lisp implementation showcases the power of functional programming. Sab can interact with a Lisp interpreter to create orders, compute costs, and handle promotional packages.

4. **Python**: The Python implementation delivers a user-friendly console program where Sab can intuitively select items, customize packages, and receive real-time payment information.

## Payment Information

Upon processing an order, the program will display the following payment information:

- Total payment amounts received for pizza orders
- Total payment amounts received for pasta orders
- Total amount of pizzas and pastas sold in the current session

Please note that data regarding sales and orders are tracked only within the current session and do not persist once the program is closed.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the requirements set forth by Federation University Australia. I extend my gratitude to them for providing the scenario and prompting the creation of this diverse implementation.

I hope this repository serves as an insightful and educational example of how the same scenario can be approached and solved using different programming languages. Enjoy exploring the Platypus Pizza and Pasta Takeaway Service!
