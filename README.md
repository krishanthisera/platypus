A single Program using four  different Languages
This implementation covers a basic scenario which will be described later, using four defeat Programming Languages.
The Scenario: 
Sab, the owner of a new Pizza and Pasta shop, is opening a takeaway service for selling delicious Pizza and Pasta to the
customers. She wants to offer some packages to interested customers to promote her business. To do so she is offering
the following packages:
1.	1 large Pizza = 12 AUD
2.	2 large Pizzas = 22 AUD
3.	N large pizzas = N*10 AUD, where N>=3, and the customer will receive 1 garlic bread for every three pizzas [For example, if a customer is interested to buy 10 large pizzas, Sab will provide 3 complimentary garlic bread for 100 AUD]
4.	1 large pasta = 8 AUD
5.	2 large pastas = 15 AUD
6.	M large pasta = M*7 AUD, where M>=3, and the customer will receive 1.25 Liter soft drinks for every 3 pasta [For example, if a customer is interested to buy 6 large pasta, Sab will provide 2 complimentary 1.25-liter soft drinks for 42 AUD]
7.	For every 3 pizzas AND 3 pasta, Sab will give a small box of Baklava (a famous dessert item) in addition garlic-bread and 1.5-liter soft drinks. You have agreed to design and develop a small console program for Sab, enabling her to select the appropriate item and the package, and calculate the corresponding cost. Once an order is processed, the program will return to the menu ready to commence another order. This payment information should display:
•	The total payment amounts received for the pizza order
•	The total payment amounts received for pasta order
•	The total amount of pizzas and pasta sold in that session*
*A session indicates the duration Sab is using the program after opening the program. There is no need for this data to
persist once the program has stopped running.
